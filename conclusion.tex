\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Backend maintenance is essential for mobile application developers. However, the mismatch of the timescales between the request demand variance and the backend capacity adaptation makes it difficult to manage the resource and the cost of the backend. To address this problem, we design a third-party cloud service Clockwork, which plans the backend capacity on a long timescale, and schedules requests on a short timescale. To start with, Clockwork exploit machine learning algorithms to predict future demand based on historical data. We show that deep learning models are powerful in prediction but take a much longer time to train than simpler models. Given the estimated future demand, we help developers minimize the backend cost with assurance of limited request delay. Then, abiding by the backend capacity, Clockwork schedules requests from all users with a fair and Pareto-optimal rate allocation mechanism, enabling individual users to prioritize their own requests, thus protecting user privacy. We have implemented the server-side of Clockwork on Amazon Web Service (AWS) platform, and the client-side on iOS-based mobile devices. Our evaluation results confirm that Clockwork can effectively help developers trim down backend cost and make a better use of backend resources.
