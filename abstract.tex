It is essential for mobile application developers to manage backend resources to serve dynamic user requests from the frontend. For a typical mobile application, the rate at which the user requests arrive at the backend fluctuates dramatically.  However, it is difficult or expensive to frequently adjust the capacity of the backend to meet the request demand.  In this paper, we present \emph{Clockwork}, a third-party cloud service, which smooths the demand profile by redistributing delay-tolerant requests and prioritizing delay-sensitive requests, so that sufficient capacity can be provided with reduced cost and wastage. To begin with, Clockwork plans the optimal backend capacity on a relatively long timescale based on future demand estimated by machine learning algorithms. We discuss pros and cons of various simple machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning algorithms, in terms of their prediction accuracy and training time. Then, Clockwork schedules user requests on a shorter timescale through a fair and Pareto-optimal rate allocation.  We implemented a fully-functional prototype of Clockwork on cloud servers and user mobile devices. The experimental results show that Clockwork can effectively help developers cut cost, as well as improve the backend utilization.
